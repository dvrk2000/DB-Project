# Health Insurance Disparities in the U.S.
## What is the project?

Our team is determined to show the disparities in healthcare insurance across the United States. We are setting out to show the various differences in healthcare insurance through multiple factors like race/ethnicity, age, and income level. The U.S. healthcare system needs to be reformed and we are hoping to start the conversation on how we can get healthcare insurance to the entire population of the U.S. by showing these disparities through impactful visualizations. We want people to see that the people without insurance matter and deserve to have the same insurances.
