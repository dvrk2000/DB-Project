# Health Insurance Disparities in the U.S.
## What is the project?

Our team is determined to show the disparities in healthcare insurance across the United States. The U.S. healthcare system needs to be reformed and we are hoping to start the conversation on how we can get healthcare insurance to the entire population of the U.S. We want to do this by showing these disparities through impactful visualizations that emphasize the importance of people that don't have healthcare coverage. We want people to see that the those without insurance matter and deserve to have affordable healthcare in some shape or form.
